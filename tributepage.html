        <h3>Early life and education : Lenin was born on April 22,1870,in Simbirsk,Russia.He came from a middle-class famlily and received a law degree from Kazan Imperial University.Political Activism: Lenin became involved in revolutionary politics during his university years. He embraced Marxism and joined various revolutionary groups, advocating for the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the establishment of a socialist state.Leadership of the Bolshevik Party: Lenin emerged as a prominent leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). He led the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution of 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the Provisional Government and the establishment of Bolshevik control in Russia.Role in the Russian Revolution: Lenin's leadership was pivotal in organizing the Bolsheviks and seizing power from the provisional government. He promoted the idea of a vanguard party leading the working class in a revolution to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat.Establishment of Soviet Government: After the October Revolution, Lenin became the head of the new Soviet government as the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom). Under his leadership, Russia underwent radical political and economic transformations.Civil War and Red Terror: Lenin's government faced internal and external opposition, leading to the Russian Civil War (1917â€“1922). During this period, the Bolsheviks, under Lenin's direction, implemented harsh measures to suppress counter-revolutionary forces, including the Red Terror.New Economic Policy (NEP): Following the Civil War and economic crisis, Lenin introduced the NEP in 1921, which allowed for limited private enterprise and market mechanisms while maintaining state control over key industries and resources.Death and Legacy: Lenin suffered a series of strokes in the early 1920s and died on January 21, 1924, at the age of 53. His death led to a power struggle within the Communist Party, eventually resulting in Joseph Stalin's rise to power. Lenin's ideas and writings, particularly his theory of vanguard party leadership and imperialism, continue to influence socialist and communist movements worldwide.</h2>
